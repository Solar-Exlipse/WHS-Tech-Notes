The new cell phone law is a good idea for a law, though it does have some flaws.
One of the many flaws I see in this law is the fact that students can't use their phones during lunch or the passing period, as none of that should be considered class time and should just be considered our own time. Another flaw I see is that simply being in the bathroom could make student be able to break the law and you can't really enforce that. The biggest flaw is the fact that some people need their phones to tell their parents where they are, if they need to get home, or if they feel safe in the school.

Computer Science could be invaluable since I am always going to need to program and code games if I want to be a game developer.
